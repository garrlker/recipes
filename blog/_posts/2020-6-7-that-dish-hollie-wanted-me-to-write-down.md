Yes, I stood up a whole website to put this recipe on... 

## Chicken and Rice

#### Ingredients
* 2 Chicken Breasts
* 2 Cups Instance Rice
* 2 Cups Chicken Broth
* 2 tbsp Butter

#### Optional Ingredients
* 1/4 Onion Chopped
* 1 tbsp Minced Garlic
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Flakes

## Directions

#### Chicken

First, smother your chicken breasts in [Strawberries BBQ Rub](http://store.strawsbbq.com/) and drizzle some oil on them.

Put them in the air fryer at 375 for 30 min, flipping and lightly re-seasoning every 10.
> You can also put them in an oven at 400 for 40 min, flipping every 20.

#### Rice
First, melt butter in a medium sized pot on **medium heat**, toss in your onions.

Once the onions start to become transparent, throw the instant rice into the pot and toss.

> You want to coat the rice with the butter.
> You can melt more butter down if some of the rice wasn't coated after the first pass.

After toasting the rice in butter for **5 minute**, throw your garlic and red chili flakes into the center of the pot. Cook those for **1 minute**.

Next, pour in the chicken broth and **bring it to a simmer**

Let it **simmer for 15 minutes on low to medium heat with a lid**.

After 15 minutes have passed, use a fork and lift up the rice in the middle of the pot and see if any water is left.

If some water pools at the bottom, simmer for another 5 minutes.

If not, your done!!!
